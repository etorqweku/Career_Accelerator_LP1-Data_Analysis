## Project Description
In order to conduct our analysis, we collected data on start-ups spanning from 2018 to 2021. We then proceeded to clean and examine this data as separate sets before consolidating them into a single dataset. While exploring the data, we identified certain issues that needed to be addressed.
While cleaning the data, we encountered several issues that required attention, including the presence of multiple currencies such as Rupees and Dollars, missing values, and misplaced values. To better understand our findings, we utilized the Matplotlib  and Seaborn library to create various graphs and visualizations. These helped us to present our results in a clear and concise manner.
